But the restless oikofugic spirit that runs in her blood would not be contained by stone walls and formal lessons. At twenty, she chose to step beyond the Citadel's protection and spent the next seventy-five years wandering the elven lands—a journey that would forever change her understanding of the world.</p><p>During those long decades of wandering, Kira discovered not just the poverty and hardship that her sheltered upbringing had hidden from her, but evidence of knowledge systematically destroyed since the cataclysm. Ancient markings on forgotten ruins, whispered stories of artifacts that could restore what was lost, fragments of truth that someone had worked very hard to erase. It was also during these years that her heart was captured by Cerys, a human woman who exists outside the boundaries of acceptable elven society.</p><p>When she finally returned to formal study at ninety-five, she did so as a fundamentally different person—someone whose keen sight could pierce through the careful omissions in every text, who could see the spaces where forbidden knowledge once lived. Now, at 117, Kira moves through the world as both seeker and smuggler of truth, her melodramatic family's disapproval following her like a shadow. Her father Valandil's hatred burns not just for her \"radical\" ideas, but for her decades of wandering and her love of Cerys.</p><p>She has chosen a path that puts her at odds with dogmatists like Auratz, whose rigid beliefs serve only to keep people ignorant. Her grief weighs upon her, as it does all elves, but she channels it into purpose—always seeking the next hidden passage, the next forgotten marking, the next secret that could free her people from the lies that bind them.</p><h2>Traits and Motivations</h2><p><em>What is their personality type?
