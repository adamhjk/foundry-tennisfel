But the restless oikofugic spirit that runs in her blood would not be contained by stone walls and formal lessons. At twenty, she chose to step beyond the Citadel's protection and spent the next seventy-five years wandering the elven lands—a journey that would forever change her understanding of the world.</p><p>During those long decades of wandering, Kira discovered not just the poverty and hardship that her sheltered upbringing had hidden from her, but evidence of knowledge systematically destroyed since the cataclysm. Ancient markings on forgotten ruins, whispered stories of artifacts that could restore what was lost, fragments of truth that someone had worked very hard to erase. It was also during these years that her heart was captured by Cerys, a human woman who exists outside the boundaries of acceptable elven society.</p><p>When she finally returned to formal study at ninety-five, she did so as a fundamentally different person—someone whose keen sight could pierce through the careful omissions in every text, who could see the spaces where forbidden knowledge once lived. Now, at 117, Kira moves through the world as both seeker and smuggler of truth, her melodramatic family's disapproval following her like a shadow. Her father Valandil's hatred burns not just for her \"radical\" ideas, but for her decades of wandering and her love of Cerys.</p><p>She has chosen a path that puts her at odds with dogmatists like Auratz, whose rigid beliefs serve only to keep people ignorant. Her grief weighs upon her, as it does all elves, but she channels it into purpose—always seeking the next hidden passage, the next forgotten marking, the next secret that could free her people from the lies that bind them.</p><h2>Traits and Motivations</h2><p><em>What is their personality type?

The @UUID[JournalEntry.vEeHCbetNoQROjEv]{Skjoldheimer} was spared due to their Runic defenses, and having closed the city to all outsiders for hundreds of years. Tennisfel's citizenry closed ranks, used the might of the Noble Guild of Vilkas to fight the plague, while the Noble Guild of Orn discovered that Demonic Possession spreads through acceptance of a blood oath - and can travel along an oath once made. This allowed the City to survive - the motto of Tennisfel imbued a kind of immunity to possession.</p><p>In the meantime, the Northern continent blamed the cataclysm on Sorcery. Many great books of magic were destroyed, many great wonders lost to time. The cataclysm also saw the disappearnce of all the old gods - there has been no Faith based magic in 300 years, it has passed into myth. </p><p>In the last 50 years, @UUID[Scene.5AsMFaWQpCNbltRl]{Tennisfel} has re-opened trade routes to the frontier, and taught people how to defeat the demon plague. The current generation is the first in hundreds of years to be born into a society that isn't beset by darkness. Elves have begun to walk the land again. Skjoldheimer sends emmisaries.

The Grand Matriarch is the head of the city, and rules the entire structure of the nation. They want to strengthen the city and its citizens (guild members all). There are no clerics per-se, but the Matriarchs and wealthy citizens guard its traditions. It bestows great material wealth on its practicioners. Belphegor's portfolio is commerce, creation, and discovery. Citizens of Tennisfel thrive on trade, discovery, and adding wealth. They swear no oaths. Followers of the Cult of Belphegor are always approached in secret, with Belphegor providing them a pathway to riches and discovery.</p></li><li><p>The Old God, god of the Earth and balance: @UUID[JournalEntry.vEeHCbetNoQROjEv]{Skjoldheimer} and the people of Abond keep the faith of the Old God (who they refuse to name, as they are the god of everything, and therefore beyond naming - Tellus is the name Catabrians gave).  The faith is ruled by the Arci of Skjoldheim, the high priest. The Fallen Cities are awash with small cult rulers claiming lineage to the old god. The Old God is the god of the earth, it is the oldest of the gods. This faith matters because it is the last functioning source of magic through rune binding. The faith in Skjoldheim wants to garner more examples of the ancient runes, so they can continue to protect their people, and expand. Priests of the Old God are sorcerers and rune binders. In society, this faith explains the creation and order of the world, and is the patron of farmers and the land. It's portfoilio is earthly concerns, rather than mortal passions or control (both of which are chaos/law). Followers of the Old God pray morning and evening.</p></li><li><p>Kasbeel, High Lord of Law, keeper of oaths. The god of ancient Catabria,  worshipped in Catabria the Lesser. Led by the King, who speaks with the force of the Law, with clergy modeled after Princes , Dukes, and Wardens. All bonded by blood oaths! Kasbeel is the god concerned with the human desire for government and rule, whose spirit is deified as the greatest and original Catabrian god-king. The faith seeks to return all to one unified rule, and dominant the world again. Their clergy are the nobility. Followers of Kasbeel are harsh arbiters of the law - they show no mercy, and an appeal to them is an appeal to pure justice. Kasbeel's portfolio is Justice, Ruling, and Cosmic Law. </p></li></ul><h1></h1><p></p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"ie1xp3dg","tags":[]}}}

The group successfully closed a demonic portal by having John's character order his controlled demon to kill the portal-summoning demon, though this resulted in his demon breaking free from its restraints. After treating Auratz's injuries with help from a doctor named Dr. Rick, the party decided to leave the city immediately with a wagon full of supplies, planning to head toward the Monastery of Les and eventually to Last Hope to continue their quest for a magical artifact needed for citizenship. The session concluded with the group preparing to depart and the game master announcing that the next session would begin with a trait vote and new belief assignments as they start their journey.</p><p>Ronan's demon broke free from its restraints after following the order to kill the portal-summoning demon. When John's character commanded the demon to attack the demon holding the portal open, the demon reluctantly obeyed while clearly struggling against the shackles and screaming at the other demons in an unknown tongue. After successfully running through the portal demon with a sword and closing the portal, the demon turned to Ronan and hissed. The other demons in the room bit off the demon's hands at the wrists, removing the shackles entirely and freeing the demon completely. The demon was last seen with two bloody stumps where its hands used to be, eyes burning bright red with rage, and no longer under Ronan's control.

My blade might deal a B3 hit to anyone I strike, but whether that’s a Superficial, Light, or Midi Wound depends on the Physical Tolerances of the person on the other end of the blade.</p><p>I might be misreading your post, but it sounds like you’re mistaking the Power+Weapon Power as the dice pool for the attack. Attacks use the relevant Weapon Skill to determine your roll. For instance, a character with 4 Power and a Dagger (+1 WP) but only a B3 in Knives would roll 3 dice on their attack, not 5.</p><p>The relevant info for damage will be the IMS (BWGR p 463). With Power 4 and 1 WP from the weapon, your IMS would be 3/5/7. 5 is from the 4Power+1WP, 3 is that number minus half (rounded up), and 7 is that number plus half (rounded down). The Shade of the IMS matches the shade of the Weapon’s power, so even Gray skilled characters need a legendary blade to deal damage in the Gray section of the PTGS. That means that this particular weapon would be deal B3/B5/B7</p><p>Meeting the obstacle to hit (1 success by default) allows you to score an Incendental hit (the I from IMS). Additional successes can be spent to move the blow on the body (usually to as less armored location) or on improving the strength of the hit.</p><p>This is what the “Add” of the weapon is for. Spend additional success equal to the Add and you will improve the blow from Incidental to Mark (M on the IMS), or from Mark to Superb (S on IMS). By default, weapons have an Add of 2, meaning you need 2 extra success (3 total) to move from I to M, and 2 more successes on top of that (5 total) to move from M to S.</p><p>Circling all the way back to your example, with 3 Successes on the roll you would score an Incidental hit (you beat Ob 1!) to deal a B3 wound and could spend the extra 2 Successes to improve that up to a Mark hit of B5. Assuming armor doesn’t ward off the attack, the target of the blow would then mark a hit of B5 on their Tolerances Grayscale and take penalties based how severe that wound is to them.</p><p>Alternately, you could try to spend those successes to move the location of the Incidental hit to a more favorable spot. See BWGR p 465 for info on moving hits.</p><p>Let me know if any of that doesn’t make sense.</p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"jupu653l","tags":[]}}}

Ronan convinced the Squirrel to give the demon to him rather than dispose of it himself, which he agreed to do (which moves the heat from the Squirrel to Ronan for having the demon in the city), and told Ronan how to use the Shackles of Control to ensure it follows his orders (because he put his blood in the shackle)</p><p>They learned that the Squirrel was hired twice by members of the Ordo Tellus - the first to arrange the kidnapping, and the second time to arrange the attempted heist in the bar.

Raised deep within the hidden halls of the Ordo Tellus—an ancient and secretive order tasked with guarding the Mokab—she was shaped not by blood, but by doctrine, ritual, and purpose. Her only tether to her past is a half-remembered lullaby and a name: <em>Auratz</em>—her  brother, lost to time.</p><p><strong>Personality:</strong>Milena is resolute, composed, and fiercely intelligent. She possesses the calm clarity of someone who knows the stakes of failure. Her belief in the Ordo’s mission is absolute—but not blind. She understands nuance, seeks understanding, and avoids bloodshed wherever possible. If she is ruthless, it is only in defense of the Mokab—and the world it holds in balance. Despite her power, she is quietly haunted by what was taken from her and what might have been.</p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong>Milena wears layered robes of forest green, charcoal grey, and earthen bronze, blending ceremonial regalia with practical functionality. A hooded mantle, trimmed in silver-threaded glyphs of the Ordo, marks her rank. She bears the <strong>Seal of Custody</strong>—a crystalline shard set in an obsidian clasp at her throat—that resonates when the Mokab is near.

Others whisper she’s not aged a day in twenty years, and that the sigils etched into the walls of the Velvet Suite draw power not only from desire—but from her.</p><p>Virelle is a woman carved from shadow and silk. She dresses simply compared to her courtesans—favoring black gowns with high collars, silver rings on every finger, and a veil of fine mesh that hides the lower half of her face. Her eyes are sharp and pale, like frost on stone. They see everything. She speaks rarely, but when she does, her voice is low and precise, as if each word has been chosen and weighed like coin.</p><p>She is not warm. She is not cruel. She is <strong>impossibly calm</strong>, even when powerful clients argue or threaten. Especially then. One noble once tried to lay hands on her in anger. He was found two days later in the canal, smiling and naked, with his mouth sewn shut with silver thread.</p><h3><strong>Reputation and Role</strong></h3><p>To the staff, she is <em>Mistress</em>, never Virelle. Her rules are few but ironclad: discretion, dignity, and devotion to the House. She personally selects the Maidens and Lords, oversees their training, and intervenes only when absolutely necessary. She walks the Moon Garden every night alone, bare-footed no matter the season, murmuring in a language none of the staff recognize.</p><p>To Tennisfel’s elite, Virelle is both gatekeeper and guardian of secrets. She determines who is granted access to the Velvet Suite and who is quietly, permanently blacklisted. Nobles, merchants, and magistrates fear her in the way one fears a locked door that might open with the wrong knock.</p><p>There are rumors, of course. That she once poisoned a prince mid-kiss. That she commands spirits bound to the stones of the brothel. That she keeps a ledger not of coin, but of secrets—bound in red leather, and written in blood.</p><h2>Traits and Motivations</h2><p>What is their personality type? Are they funny?

{"_id":"epVqsEYGQUqa2sCX","name":"Intro to Burning Wheel","pages":[{"_id":"adFFI9vprrhJN9dE","name":"Main","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>I really want to figure out how to tell a very long game in a setting we all create together, because those are the funnest games I've ever been a part of, and we're old enough that I feel like we can really pull it off. :)</p><h2>What is Burning Wheel?</h2><p>An RPG that is designed to tell character-centered stories by encouraging players to fight for what they believe.</p><p>Unlike a lot of \"story\" centric RPGs, Burning Wheel is absolutely a game - if we're going to play it long term, it's because we will all decide we want to learn how to play it. It demands a lot more of players than other games do.</p><p>Burning Wheel basically says that Characters + Situation + Tests = Game</p><p>Burning Wheel makes it clear that you, the player, are very much not your character. The game rewards you (the player) for taking risks, and for failing (for example, in the long term, you only learn or improve your skills by trying to use them, regardless of success or failure). The more you put your character into difficult situations that challenge them, the more fun the game will be, and the more powerful your character will become. You have to be active. Take risks. Throw caution to the wind. Failure moves the story forward.</p><p>You communicate to me what your character believes, what your instincts are, and your character traits. I then create obstacles that will test your beliefs, insintcts, and traits. If you play your character according those beliefs (either by embracing them, or fighting against them, etc) then you are rewarded with advancement, a special economy called Artha that allows you manipulate the dice, and the setting evolving around you.</p><p>That's why I think it's perfect for running a really long game. We can build not only your characters, but the entire setting, and develop the fiction of it together. Because it's a game that the players play, and not that the GM just presents, it's going to be easier for me to GM</p><h2>How the game works mechanically</h2><h3>Dice and Exponent</h3><p>The game uses a d6 dice-pool mechanic. Each Stat, Attribute or Skill has a number of dice you will roll, and a 'shade' that indicates the difficulty number you need to hit. All of your dice are shaded black - which means you need to roll a 4,5, or 6 to succeed. The value for a Stat, Attribute, or Skill is called its 'exponent'</p><p>For example, Gunther the knight has a B4 'Axe' Skill. So if he would roll four dice, and each dice would be a success if its a 4,5,6 (the 'black' shade).</p><h3>Tests</h3><p>You will tell me what you want to do in the game, expressed as your Intent and the Task. Intent is what you want to do. The task is how you want to do it. For example:</p><p>Intent: \"I kill him\"Task: \"By stabbing him with my sword\"</p><p>Intent: \"I convince him\"Task: \"By persuading him to take my side by explaining his wifes affair with the cardinal\"</p><p>Once that's clear, we will <em>both</em> agree on what skill we are testing.</p><p>Then I'll set an Obstacle, which is the number of successes you need to accomplish it, and a sense of the consequences if you fail. If you get those successes, than you get whatever your intent was! If you fail, then something complicated will happen that drives the story forward.</p><p><em>If you succeed, you complete the action the way you have described it!</em></p><p>It will never be like D&D, where you roll Charisma, and you fail, and that's that. Something will always happen.</p><p>Be prepared to fail a lot more in Burning Wheel than you might in D&D. Failure leads to complication, not absolute failure. The complications move the story forward, creating more momentum.</p><h3>Let it Ride</h3><p>Once we've made a test, the results stand for the rest of the session. You cannot re-test something without the situation changing. This goes both ways! If you win, you win. If you lose, you lose. Let It Ride means the results stand.</p><h3>Carefully, Patiently, Quickly</h3><p>By default, you test things 'normally'.</p><p>You can also work 'Carefully' - you get a +1D advantage, but it takes longer, and the complications for failure likely get worse.</p><p>You can work 'Patiently', and if you get more successes than you need, you can assign them to increase the outcome.</p><p>You can work 'Quickly', which shortens the time it takes to do something by 10% for each success.</p><h3>Help</h3><p>You can help each other on a test. If you want to help, you say how you want to help, what the skill you'll be using is, and then the player you are helping has to accept your aid. If your skill is 4 or lower, you give 1D to the other person. If it's 5 or better, you give 2D.</p><p>Skills may help skills and stats. Stats may help stats. Circles may help Circles. Resources may help resources.</p><h3>Fields of Related Knowledge (FoRK)</h3><p>You can also 'FoRK' a skill into the test. For example, if you are laying waste with your axe, you can describe not only how you are swinging your Axe, but that you're kicking and headbutting while you do it, which FoRKs your brawling skill into your Axe for 1D.</p><p>If you have '-wise' skills, those are specific knowledge, and they are generally really fun to use with FoRK. You can FoRK as many skills as you can justify.</p><h3>Beginners Luck</h3><p>It is likely that we will come up with tests for skills you do not have. If we were playing for a long time, that is how you would learn new skills! When you do this, your obstacle will be doubled. So if it is an Ob2 for a skilled person, it'll be Ob4 for you.</p><p>Remember, in Burning Wheel, failure complicates the situation - it's never black and white, so you might still get what you want even in failure, just with a complication. Put your beliefs on the line and roll with it.</p><h3>Tests drive the story</h3><p>Tests drive the story in burning wheel. You won't roleplay an argument and win based on how great you roleplay. You'll win or lose based on your test. But the more you roleplay your intent and task, the better. (It's a game!)</p><h3>Artha</h3><p>Artha provides points that you can spend to influence how tests are resolved. In this beginning game you have two kinds of artha: 2 Fate and 1 Persona. You gain fate points for manifesting your Beliefes, or playing your Instincts. You gain persona points for embodying the mood at the table perfectly, playing out inner turmoil between your beliefs and a decision, achieving personal goals, being voted the MVP, etc. There is also 'Deeds' artha, which are awarded by the GM when the player accomplishes a deed of great renown.</p><p>In a long game, we would award Artha at the end of every session. In this session, we won't bother.</p><p>In practice- you can spend a Fate point <em>after</em> you roll the dice to make any D6 'open-ended'. That means if you rolled a six, you can grab another dice and add it to the pool. So have 3 6's? Spend a fate and you get 3 more dice to roll for successes!</p><p>Your persona can be spend to add +1D to any test.</p><h2>Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits</h2><p>These are the things that drive the game forward. Tests are how we resolve things. Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits are <em>why</em> you're doing them in the first place.</p><h3>Beliefs</h3><p>Every character has 3 beliefs (sometimes four). They are the top priorities for the character in play. They aren't general things, like \"God\". They are explicit drives that tie in to the world, the situation, and the characters relationships. They are <em>player</em> priorities - its you telling the game what you want to have happen in the fiction. For example:</p><p>\"I must serve the Etharch so that I might be redeemed for my crime\"</p><p>\"I will protect my friends sister at any cost\"</p><p>They are how you set your character at odds with the setting. They are public -- all the players know each others beliefs, and the GM does as well. Your <em>characters</em> don't. But we all do. Playing for or against your beliefs is how the game moves forward, and it gives you artha to spend (so the economy of the game is about writing beliefs, playing for your beliefs, passing tests for obstacles in the way of following your beliefs, and earning artha for doing it)</p><p>You get to change your beliefs over time in the long game. Each session, likely.</p><h3>Instincts</h3><p>If beliefs reflect who and what the character is, Instincts represent how you act. You choose three, and they are usually defined as Always/If/Never conditions. They say if a condition occurs, the action is done automatically. For example, you might have an instinct that is \"I always draw my sword at the first sign of trouble\". If a situation occurs where there is trouble, you can be assumed to have drawn your sword automatically! They can't allow you to bypass a test, but they can basically rewind time to ensure you had a change to make the test some time before the situation began.</p><h3>Traits</h3><p>Character traits are the most prominent aspects of your character. For example, if you have the Trait 'Bearded', you have the most magnificent beard in beard town. If you take 'Brutal', you'll act in brutal ways, and everyone knows it. You might play into a trait, or you might be trying to loose it by playing against it. Both are great ways to earn Artha, and make the game more fun.</p><p>Some traits are \"Call-on traits\". These are things that, once a session, you can do. For example, the 'Fleet Footed' trait lets you add 1D, once a session, to any test related to movement or running.</p><p>Die Traits always modify a dice role, the same way, every time.</p><p>In a long game, players actually vote to give each other Traits based on how they play, or remove traits that are no longer fitting.</p><h2>Base setting</h2><p>Burning Wheel has a setting that's roughly like Tolkien set at the technology level of France in the 13-14th century. It makes no attempt at \"balance\". Different characters play differently, and interact differently with the setting - Elves are immortal, magical. Sorcerers are powerful and can pay a steep price for failure. The game works best when we wrap our setting around the rules, rather than adapt the rules to the setting.</p><h2>Sub-Systems</h2><p>As the stakes for things increase, Burning Wheel has sub-systems that make the game more narratively intense. It has Duel of Wits to resolve social conflict, where the winning side of the argument binds the loser to what they want. It has multiple kinds of martial conflict, ranging from simple tests to \"Bloody Versus\" and a hyper detailed Fight mechanic. It has rules for Ranged combat. We'll introduce those slowly over time.</p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"rd0bw951","tags":[]}}}

I will prove to her my prowess and serve at her side <em>[relationship/setting]</em></p></li></ul><p>Okay! Per a recent request, here’s my can’t-fail always-awesome recipe for perfect <em>Burning Wheel</em> beliefs every time. One pot, quick clean-up, 10 minutes of prep.</p><p>Suuuuper quick backgrounder for anyone who doesn’t know how <em>Burning Wheel</em> works: in BW, you earn “artha” in various flavors for interacting with your Beliefs, Instincts and Traits, or BITs. Bs and Is are player-authored; traits start out coming from lifepaths you chose at character creation, and later they’re voted onto your character <em>whether you want them or not</em> because of how you play. But the entire game is built on carrots, not sticks, so even if you end up with a poopy Trait, or wrote bad Beliefs or Instincts, you’re never obligated to play toward them. You just don’t get paid artha.</p><p>What comes next is a summation of my best practices from being The World’s Biggest <em>Burning Wheel</em> Superfan many moons ago. I still adore the game but it’s been a while since I was hardcore about it. Anyway, don’t take anything I’m about to write as rules. It’s just ideas for building an efficient artha machine that’s also fun to play.</p><p><strong>Beliefs</strong> come in two forms: actionable and ongoing. Actionable Beliefs are things you can complete, typically in service to a larger goal. So like…your larger goal might be “I will open the Eastern Shores to trade with my kingdom.” And your first Belief might read, in total:</p><p><em>“I will open the Eastern Shores to trade with my kingdom, but first I must travel there myself and discover what they need of us.”</em></p><p>So you do the traveling thing and ask around about what they need, boom, you’ve completed that Belief. Then you’d update it:</p><p><em>“I will open the Eastern Shores to trade with my kingdom. Now that I know they need seed, I’ll secure a supplier back home.”</em> And then you go working on that.</p><p>The other kind of Belief, ongoing, isn’t intended to ever be “done.” You keep it open because you want Fate. Fate is one of the two main kinds of artha you can chase. The other is Persona, and you get that for, among other things, achieving your Beliefs. An ongoing Belief usually sounds more like, you know, things you believe. Like:</p><p><em>“Sir Jerkface cannot be trusted.”</em> Or <em>“I can’t leave town, the gnolls will eat me.”</em> And each time you act on that distrust or that fear, boom, Fate. They might get resolved too! But you haven’t built that Belief for that purpose, because you want a steady income of <em>both</em> Fate and Persona. They’re each useful in their own way.</p><p><strong>Instincts</strong> also come in a couple flavors: useful and colorful. The best Instincts are both! And you want both, because Instincts that cause trouble for you are the ones that earn you artha. So a purely useful one like “Always scope out an escape route” or “Never be the first one to eat or drink something new,” well, those are just <em>useful.</em> They’re a way to make sure the GM doesn’t trip over your schtick. The tactical genius always has a way out, the paranoiac never gets poisoned.</p><p>Straight colorful ones are good too, because they usually get you in trouble or otherwise complicate your life. “Always draw your weapon on a stranger” is a terrible idea, right! It <em>might</em> be useful if you’re getting jumped in a dark alleyway, but the king’s guard won’t like it one bit when you arm yourself before them. Best-best practice is to come up with Instincts that are both useful and colorful: maybe good, maybe complicating.</p><p><strong>Traits</strong> aren’t up to you at character creation so I’ll skip those, other than to mention they exist, and you get paid when your trait adds context or complication to your situation.</p><p>Mark asked about “workshopping” Beliefs. That’s a big and important part to making sure the game starts right. The right Beliefs make sure the GM always has something to grab onto, the players always know what to chase after if they don’t have something in the plot already drawing their attention, and it keeps tone and momentum on the same page. Built correctly, it’s also an energetic artha engine and you’ll have lots of fate and persona at hand.</p><p>Anyway! That perfect formula goes like this:</p><p>1 Belief or Instinct about the GM’s situation. Usually the GM will pitch the game around one or more core things. Think Fronts from <em>Apocalypse World.</em></p><p>1 Belief or Instinct about another PC.</p><p>1 Belief about something in the setting that interests you personally. Your flag to the GM that says “I’m really interested in this thing.” Yes, just a Belief, not an Instinct in this case.</p><p>1 Belief or Instinct that’s just totally <em>wrong.</em> Like, you’re just straight up mistaken or incorrect about something.</p><p>1 Belief or Instinct that contradicts another of your BITs in some way.</p><p>1 Instinct that illustrates an important bias in the character.</p><p>That’s six things. Obviously you’ll need to double up on a few of these.</p><p>You’ll know if the formula is working because you’ll get paid. Artha is mechanically useful, but it’s also a good canary in the coal mine so to speak. If you’re not getting paid, change your Bs or Is until you do.</p><p><em>Workshopping</em> is where everyone works all this stuff out at the table at the same time. Good BW play means intertwining your Beliefs and Instincts so they trigger each other in obvious ways. Inobvious ways as well! But that’s on the GM to uncover later. You also want to make sure you have about a 50/50 division between internal and external tensions. If it’s all external, you have a very traditional “party” and that’s boring. If it’s all internal, it gets really fraught really fast. Hard for long-term play.</p><p>The GM is a biiig part of workshopping because they will want to know early on what “challenging your Belief” looks like. A bad Belief will be hard for the GM to know what to do with. Usually, IME, it’s because the player has come up with something they could have already done. So when I’m GMing and I’m feeling iffy about a Belief, the first thing I will ask is “so why haven’t you done this already?” Particularly when it comes to actionable Beliefs.</p><p>Workshopping is also something I found myself doing every three or four sessions during extended play. By then, the players will have seen if their little drama engines were burping up artha or not. If they’re not, then we talk about the stuff that isn’t firing.</p><p>I feel like the minimum artha you should be getting off your BIT machine is 2 fate and 1 persona. Personally I feel like it was a successful session if I got 3 fate and 2 persona, but that takes a lot of hustle and a GM who’s paying attention.</p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"teu9i0o0","tags":[]}}}

All truths erode. But entropy is not death—it is design, if you have the clarity to see the pattern before it crumbles.”</em></p></blockquote><h3><strong>Core Philosophy</strong></h3><p>The Cult of the Entropic Synaxis believes <strong>Entropy is not an enemy to be resisted</strong>, but the only force in the cosmos that is truly honest. From collapse comes pattern. From death, transformation. From decay, revelation. Their central pursuit is to uncover the <strong>Truths of Entropic Patterning</strong>—the structures that inevitably emerge from collapse—and to shape society, bloodlines, and power structures according to those patterns before others even notice the shift.</p><p>Whereas the gods of Law and Chaos represent absolutes, and the Old God a fading memory of harmony, the Synaxis seeks neither worship nor equilibrium. They <strong>reject divinity</strong> as a lie humanity tells itself to delay its decline. Instead, they study decline to master it.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Structure & Hierarchy</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>The Synaxis</strong> – The ruling council of seven Matrices. Each Matrix is a master of a different Domain of Entropy: Flesh, Memory, Thought, Lineage, Structure, Movement, and Voice. They guide the long projects of the Cult, and sometimes war amongst themselves through subtle games of influence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oracles of Dust</strong> – Seers who read meaning in collapse: broken machines, failed marriages, fallen empires. They are the Cult’s most revered prophets, though often mad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Symmetra</strong> – Field agents and whisperers trained in the arts of seduction, rhetoric, memory manipulation, and poison. They shape the world by influencing key figures, cultivating chaos that leads to the Cult’s intended design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Neophytes</strong> – Recruited as children, rigorously trained in perception, emotional detachment, and the Cult’s language of Patterning. Only a fraction survive initiation.</p></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Practices and Beliefs</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Patterning</strong> – The core mystical practice. Practitioners study events not to change them directly, but to nudge systems during moments of imbalance. “One grain of sand placed well is better than a thousand thrown blindly.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Lineage Curation</strong> – Like the Bene Gesserit, they breed bloodlines over generations, seeking not purity, but potential—those predisposed to influence, adapt, and endure collapse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rites of Decay</strong> – Rituals where members symbolically (or literally) destroy something precious to extract its final truths. These are private, often terrifying moments of transformation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Memory Grafting</strong> – The most advanced of the Synaxis learn to integrate the sensory and emotional echoes of the dead. Not necromancy, but disciplined entanglement—“A memory is just entropy clinging to mind.”</p></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Aesthetic</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Symbol</strong>: A broken spiral tightening into a black dot. It represents collapse refining into singular insight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Robes of layered ash-gray and deep rust-red.

Above it, a timber frame swollen with damp and age supports sagging tin sheeting and patchwork shutters, each bearing the scars of storms long past.</p><p>The main entrance is a rolling iron door, dented and streaked with corrosion.

Success will earn them citizenship, wealth, and political standing within the House. The party’s benefactor, Mira Orn, seeks to become High Matron of her House, and has entrusted the Firm with this mission.</p><p><strong>Session 1: The Kidnapping of Mira Orn</strong></p><p>The adventure began at the Black Hearted Crone Tavern, where the party awaited Mira Orn and her husband Bojan. Bojan arrived distraught, announcing Mira’s kidnapping and the ransacking of their home.At the Orn estate, the group found evidence linking the Malthulis Family to the abduction—blood, a torn cloak with their tailor’s mark, and a hidden chamber behind the library’s shelves. Inside, they discovered:</p><p>A Map to the Mokab</p><p>An Orb of Healing</p><p>Mira’s old adventuring gear</p><p>When Johhan Johhaness (Ryan) touched the orb, he received a vision of his future greatness as a king and artifact hunter. Keeping this to himself, he and the others resolved to rescue Mira.</p><p><strong>Session 2: The Rescue</strong></p><p>The Firm confronted Uncle Vanya Malthulis, who agreed to reveal who hired his family—the Squirrel, a notorious fixer—in exchange for a future cut of the party’s citizenship boon.After sealing the deal with a bond stabbed into Vanya’s hollow throne, the group tracked the Squirrel’s trail. They consulted the Jackal (Cerys, Kira’s lover) and learned that the Orb was not one of Healing but a Chaos Orb, tied to human emotion.</p><p>Following the lead to a warehouse, the party incited a riot to mask their infiltration. Inside, they discovered Mira bound and tortured by members of the Ordo Tellus, including Auratz’s estranged sister. After rescuing Mira, she revealed that she bought the Mokab map from Volho the Sincere, an information broker in Last Hope. Mira confirmed her belief that the Mokab is real and that recovering it would secure both her and the Firm’s political ascent.</p><p><strong>Session 3: Shadows in the Crone</strong></p><p>Back at the Black Hearted Crone, the group debriefed with Mira and Bojan. Their planning was cut short when hired thieves tried to steal the map. Interrogation revealed that agents of the Squirrel had arranged the theft, pushing the party toward the Lusty Maiden, a high-end brothel where the Squirrel was last seen.</p><p><strong>Session 4: Secrets at the Lusty Maiden</strong></p><p>Using Mira’s citizenship to gain entry, the group infiltrated the Lusty Maiden. Each character chose their style of “encounter,” but Kira (Travis) was drawn into a deeper bargain with Mistress Virelle, the enigmatic madam.Virelle offered a “truth for a truth,” written in blood. Kira confessed the Firm’s entire plan to retrieve the Mokab—and in return learned that the Squirrel was hired by Milena Ordo Tellus and was currently in the Velvet Room on the third floor.</p><p>The group stormed the secret chamber and found the Squirrel mid-orgy with a woman bound in Shackles of Control—who revealed herself to be possessed by a demon of Asmodeus, the Lord of Lust. The encounter turned violent and chaotic as the Firm prepared to subdue both the Squirrel and the demonic entity.</p><p><strong>Session 5: The Demon’s Bargain</strong></p><p>The Firm confronted the Squirrel and the possessed woman. The demon spoke in tongues—naming Asmodeus and Belphegor, radiating oppressive desire.Ronan Vale (Smart) negotiated with the Squirrel to take possession of the demon rather than see it destroyed. The Squirrel, relieved, surrendered the Shackles of Control and explained their use: blood-bound obedience.</p><p>In exchange for silence about his vices, the Squirrel admitted to being hired twice by the Ordo Tellus—first to kidnap Mira, then to steal the map. Pressured by Auratz, he revealed the Ordo’s safehouse address in Skjoldtown.</p><p>At the tenement, the party found the Ordo packing to flee. Auratz infiltrated the building disguised as a servant, only to meet an assassin whose eyes flashed with demonic purple light. The assassin—under the influence of the Entropic Synaxis, a cult preaching divine entropy—attempted to convince Auratz to kill Milena Ordo Tellus, his own sister.When Auratz tried to intervene magically, he botched the casting—summoning a demon-possessed undead that devoured the assassin’s head and opened a portal to the Abyss.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ronan interrogated his bound demon, learning more of its masters—Asmodeus, Lord of Lust, and Belphegor, the Demon of Corruption through Invention—just as the portal burst open and chaos erupted.</p><p><strong>Session 6: The Portal Opens</strong></p><p>As demons poured through the rift, Auratz leapt from the third-story window with his unconscious sister, breaking his arm upon landing.Upstairs, the guards fought desperately while the rest of the party arrived—only to freeze in terror. Ronan and Johhan stood paralyzed with fear, while Kira and Seban fled screaming from the room as undead horrors clawed their way into the mortal world.</p><p><strong>Session 7: Fire and Flight</strong></p><p>The chaos culminated in Ronan ordering his bound demon to kill the portal-summoning demon. It obeyed with fury, cleaving the creature and closing the rift—but at a terrible cost. The other demons tore off its hands, freeing it from its shackles. With stumps aflame and eyes burning red, the demon turned on Ronan before being left behind in the burning ruin.</p><p>Auratz received medical care from Dr. Rick, and the Firm decided to flee Tennisfel altogether. They gathered supplies, loaded a wagon, and set course for the Monastery of Les, then onward to Last Hope, where Volho the Sincere awaits—and perhaps, the truth of the Mokab.The session ended with the party regrouping, preparing for Trait Votes and new Beliefs before the next phase of their story.</p><h2>Character Highlights</h2><p><strong>Ronan Vale (Smart)</strong></p><p>Negotiated possession of the bound demon, taking on its burden and risking corruption.</p><p>Commanded the demon to slay another, closing the portal but losing control of his own infernal servant.</p><p>Has begun a dangerous slide into moral ambiguity—his soul tied to infernal forces he believes he can master.</p><p><strong>Auratz Kord (Tony)</strong></p><p>Discovered his sister was part of the Ordo Tellus, setting up a deep family and ideological conflict.</p><p>Botched a spell that unleashed the undead demon and the abyssal portal.</p><p>Bravely leapt from a third-story window to save his sister, breaking his arm and nearly dying.</p><p>Faces guilt, injury, and questions about his family’s role in the growing demonic crisis.</p><p><strong>Kira (Travis)</strong></p><p>Unearthed Mira’s secret vault and the map to the Mokab.</p><p>Spilled the Firm’s secrets to Mistress Virelle in exchange for critical intel about the Squirrel.</p><p>Used Song of Soothing to manipulate crowds during dangerous missions.</p><p>Torn between loyalty to the Firm and curiosity for forbidden truths.</p><p><strong>Johhan Johhaness (Ryan)</strong></p><p>Identified the Orb and experienced a prophetic vision of his own greatness and kingship.</p><p>Struggled with fear and paralysis in the presence of demonic horror.</p><p>Acts as a grounding influence for the group, even as his ambitions threaten to overtake his humility.</p><p><strong>Seban (Brad)</strong></p><p>Often serves as pragmatic muscle or moral balance.</p><p>First to flee in the face of true demonic terror—illustrating the group’s humanity amidst chaos.</p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"wwgr2k22","tags":[]}}}

Adam explained they would run through a similar introduction to the game and use a mirror board to guide the setting process, including tone, situation details, and character creation. The group agreed to skip the traditional one-shot session, as everyone seemed committed to the project. Tony mentioned an urgent painting task for a video shoot, while the group also briefly discussed a spinning globe device powered by magnets. The session concluded with Adam outlining their plan to collaboratively design the game world, starting with an overview of Burning Wheel's mechanics and character creation process.</p><h3><strong>Burning Wheel Role-Playing Mechanics</strong></h3><p>Adam explained the mechanics and philosophy of the Burning Wheel role-playing game, emphasizing its focus on player agency and character development through a system of beliefs, instincts, and tests. He described how players can influence the game world by declaring intentions and tasks, with outcomes determined by dice rolls and the game's complex mechanics. Adam highlighted the game's unique features, such as the \"let it ride\" rule, helping mechanics, and the use of Arthur points for character advancement. He also explained how beliefs and instincts drive the narrative, allowing players to shape the story through their character's priorities and actions.</p><h3><strong>Game Mechanics and Setting Development</strong></h3><p>Adam explained the rules and mechanics of the game, focusing on traits, beliefs, and instincts as key aspects of character development. He emphasized that traits cannot be used to bypass tests but can be modified or removed through roleplay. Adam also outlined the process for creating a custom setting, starting with brainstorming inspiration and tone, followed by developing a one-sentence setting description and further details. The group discussed the frequency of trait votes, with Adam suggesting they might occur every 3, 6, or 12 sessions depending on the game's pace.</p><h3><strong>Fantasy World's Magic and Culture</strong></h3><p>The group discussed world-building elements for their fantasy game, focusing on a setting with low-magic or rare-magic themes. They explored various cultural approaches to magic, including oppressive regimes that suppress practitioners, and the idea of sorcerer kings or divine leaders ruling in league with demons. The players discussed character concepts, with Travis planning to play an elf lore master, Tony considering a dark, Nordic-themed character, and others interested in playing non-magic users in a world where magic is feared or oppressed. The group agreed to focus on a world where sorcerer-kings or divine leaders rule, potentially with hidden magical orders working in the shadows.</p><h3><strong>Rebuilding After Demon Catastrophe</strong></h3><p>The group discussed a fantasy world setting where a demonic catastrophe occurred 200 years ago, leading to the fall of civilizations and loss of knowledge. They agreed to focus on a setting where nascent kingdoms are beginning to reform and reconnect, with the main story starting in a central town. The world features noble houses that can manipulate demons, and the group decided to explore the idea of starting the game as the \"bad guys\" who gradually realize the severity of the situation. They also discussed the possibility of having characters from distant, wild societies that are beginning to interact with the main continent.</p><h3><strong>Baltic-Inspired World Building Elements</strong></h3><p>The group discussed world-building elements for their game, focusing on character ages and cultural setting. They agreed on a 4-life-path system (mid-20s to early 30s) and settled on a Baltic-inspired culture with wandering traders and a history of demonic influence. The group explored themes of familial connections, the value of old age, and the presence of demons as both a threat and a subtle force affecting society. They considered different approaches to character relationships, including being part of a trading guild or accidental fellowship, with Adam suggesting that character motivations could stem from their ties to the trading culture.</p><h3><strong>Post-Apocalyptic City-State Setting</strong></h3><p>The group discussed the setting for their game, focusing on a post-apocalyptic world 200 years after a calamity. They described Tennisfell, a major city rebuild in the ruins of a former democracy, where noble houses compete for power. Ryan's character would be from Skjoldheimr, a Nordic area protected by runes that is now facing a population crisis and must expand. The group explored themes of resource scarcity, barter economies, and the high value of knowledge and artifacts in this harsh environment.</p><h3><strong>World of Magic and Rebuilding</strong></h3><p>The group discussed the world's magic system, where sorcery binds chaos, enchanting binds old gods into items, and summoning binds demons. They explored the cultural differences between Skoldheim, which uses runic enchantment, and Tennisfell, which has Templars regulating magic and views science as sorcery. The world features humans, elves, and half-demons, along with traditional monsters like demons, orcs, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and undead. The setting is a post-calamity world where societies are rebuilding, resources are limited, and the environment has been corrupted, with a focus on the kingdom of Tennisfell as the central location.</p><h3><strong>Orn House Power Struggle Narrative</strong></h3><p>The group discussed different types of conflicts for their role-playing game setting, ultimately deciding to focus on a \"struggle\" narrative where the House of Orn is becoming increasingly powerful through manipulation and violence. They agreed to have three opposing houses (out of five total) working against Orn's rise to power, with characters potentially having different allegiances and moral stances regarding Orn's methods. The group also discussed potential character motivations and alliances, with Tony expressing interest in working for Orn while others might oppose them, and they explored naming conventions for the houses, settling on \"Vilks\" as one of the house names.</p><h3><strong>Game World Factions and Conflicts</strong></h3><p>The group discussed the world-building and plot dynamics for their game, focusing on the relationships and motivations of various factions, including Lob, Orn, Vilcas, and others. They explored potential conflicts, such as alliances with old monsters or demons, and the consequences of these alliances on the world. The group also considered the roles of artifact hunters as their faction and the implications of their actions on the broader narrative. They agreed to continue developing the world, create characters, and eventually play through the story they are building.</p><p></p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"yh3hogyn","tags":[]}}}

She offered to share a truth for a truth, the quality of which would be determined by the value of the secret shared by Kira - but the secret had to be written in blood. @UUID[JournalEntry.EzGmjrBqcLoMjV0z]{Kira (Travis)} agreed, and told @UUID[JournalEntry.ONTQifVR1MCvk8ji]{Mistress Virelle} all about the Firms plan to get the Mokab, the map, and the squirrel. She revealed that the squirrel was hired by a woman named @UUID[JournalEntry.G95s6DqiAVrBg65e]{Milena Ordo Tellus}, and that they've been coming and going for the last day, and that he is currently on the third floor. Kira spots the secret door on her way up. </p><p>Meanwhile the rest of the group distracted their companions, spoke to an agent of the Entropic Synaxis who shared that the Squirrel is in the Velvet Room on the third floor, accessible only by a secret door. </p><p>They come up with a plan to rush into the room as a group, overwhelm the butler, and then intimidate the squirrel into giving up the information. They succeed, and see the Squirrel seated at a large circular couch, and in the middle a naked woman cuffed with Shackles of Control (cuffs that can only be opened and sealed with a drop of a persons blood, and which suppresses magical abilities) and with an elven chain. She's engaged with two other people. As they intimidate the Squirrel and mention the map and the mokab, the woman reveals herself to be possessed by a minor demon of  Asmodeus, Chaos Lord of Lust, by turning her head around 180 degrees, and speaking at them in a language they do not understand, but they can make out the word \"Tellus\", with spitting fury. </p><p>The Squirrel has been intimidated, and is going to crack under the pressure, and the Demon must be dealt with.</p><p></p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"yhs5v56x","tags":[]}}}

The elves there continue the rituals as if they will work, but the state of the forest is that it is clearly blighted. It lives, but like a wheeze.</p></li><li><p>It's raining, it's muddy, and it is miserable</p></li><li><p>After a few days travel, you are looking forward to stopping at an inn at the crossroads called The Cozy Gnome, and perhaps replenishing your food supplies.</p></li><li><p>As you near the end of your second day, the trees change - they go from blighted and twisted to thriving. Meadows have been cleared, and small farm houses start to appear. It's deeply out of season, and none of this was here in your memory.</p></li><li><p>At the crossroads, where some of you remember there being only an inn, there is now a small village - the outskirts are surrounded by crops, livestock, none of this should be here this time of year </p></li></ul><p>Kira used song of paths and ways to make sure you stayed on the right path.</p><p>Johhan tried his hand at hunting to try and find some game, and failed, to his shame.</p><p>Seban used Forest-wise to determine that the soil has been enriched, likely by blood magic like they use in Abond, which is a land where the pesants have given themselves over as vassals to vampire lords in exchange for prosperity and growth.</p><p>The party met Portius, the son of the innkeeper. He is a good and kind soul, who was happy to help. He asks about Milena, and says that Lord Jacques should be able to help. He also mentions that Lady Hansa is a wonderful woman who could also be of aid.</p><p>Kira sings for the parties supper and room and board.</p><p>The inn responds particuarly strongly to any idea that Lord Jacque is anything but amazing. They mention that living here with him is mich better than they would've been treated in Tennisfel.</p><p>Lady Hansa arrives at the inn after dark, and Portius introduces the party to her. She agrees to look at Milena, and casts a spell of Augury to determine what the cause of her coma is. To do so she uses candles and her own blood, drawn from her fangs - which reveals to her that Milena was struck while opening a portal, and her soul is trapped elsewhere. She is not strong enough to help, but her father would be.</p><p>As she says this, a terrible wailing scream is heard from outside the inn - the kind of heartbreak that means true tragedy has occured. She rapidly excuses herself, saying Sanne under her breath, and rushes out of the room. The party follows her, and that's where we pick up.</p><p>You have 3D of wealth in the wagon</p><p>The party has 3 days of food, and two days of water remaining</p><p>Milena has 6 days to live</p><p></p>"},"sort":0}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"tennisfel":{"legendkeeper_id":"z64mr5ii","tags":[]}}}
