I want to create a new module for the foundry virtual tabletop called 'tennisfel'.

We will be converting data from legendkeeper/tennisfel.json to content inside our foundry module.

Using https://foundryvtt.com/article/module-development as a reference guide, your first task is to set up our new module. It should have a compendium pack for scenes called tennisfel scenes.
